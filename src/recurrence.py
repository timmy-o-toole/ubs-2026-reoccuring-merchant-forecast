"""Detects recurring merchant streams per client from raw transactions.

A "stream" is a cluster of a client's transactions at the same mcc and a
similar amount, found via 1D amount clustering rather than exact
description matching. This is necessary because some recurring
subscriptions rotate their description text month to month (e.g.
"digital plus" -> "premium plan" -> "media streaming" for what is really
one Netflix-like charge) while staying at a near-constant amount and
cadence - grouping by literal description or by a single per-transaction
category label would split or mis-drop those cycles. See category_map.py
for the details behind this design.

A stream is flagged as recurring if it has >=2 transactions at a roughly
regular ~monthly cadence and a stable amount. Its category is assigned by
majority vote across the keyword-derived per-transaction categories of its
own members (imputing across the rotating-description cycles); a stream
with zero keyword evidence anywhere stays unresolved (category=None).
