"""Detects recurring merchant streams per client from raw transactions.

A "stream" is a cluster of a client's transactions at a similar amount
(pooled across mccs), found via 1D amount clustering rather than exact
description matching. This is necessary because some recurring
subscriptions rotate their description text month to month (e.g.
"digital plus" -> "premium plan" -> "media streaming" for what is really
one Netflix-like charge) while staying at a near-constant amount and
cadence - grouping by literal description or by a single per-transaction
category label would split or mis-drop those cycles. See category_map.py
for the details behind this design.

A stream is flagged as recurring if it has >=2 transactions at a roughly
regular ~monthly cadence and a stable amount. Its category is assigned by
majority vote across the keyword-derived per-transaction categories of its
own members (imputing across the rotating-description cycles); a stream
with zero keyword evidence anywhere stays unresolved (category=None).
